A series of AI/ML experiments.

### Environment Config
You'll need the Python (3.10) and Poetry configured on your machine. Once those are configured, create a virtual environment and install dependencies.

```bash
python3.10 -m venv venv

. venv/bin/activate

pip install --upgrade pip

make install
```
